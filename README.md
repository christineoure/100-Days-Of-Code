## Overview

This repository is part of the "100 Days of Code" initiative where each day focuses on a new challenge. The challenges are designed to:

- **Enhance your Python programming skills**
- **Build a strong foundation in data science**
- **Implement machine learning models**
- **Dive into deep learning with neural networks**
- **Master data visualization techniques**

Throughout these 100 days, you'll work on projects ranging from simple data manipulation tasks to complex end-to-end machine learning pipelines and deep learning models.

---

## Objectives

- **Improve Coding Skills:** Daily coding exercises to enhance your Python proficiency.
- **Data Science:** Learn to clean, manipulate, and analyze datasets.
- **Machine Learning:** Develop and evaluate predictive models using popular libraries.
- **Deep Learning:** Build and train neural networks for various applications.
- **Data Visualization:** Create insightful visualizations to communicate data-driven insights.
- **Documentation & Reproducibility:** Document your work thoroughly to ensure reproducibility and shareability.

---

## Project Structure

The repository is organized to reflect the daily challenges:


Each day's folder contains:
- A **Jupyter Notebook** (`notebook.ipynb`) with the lesson, examples, and exercises.
- A **README.md** with detailed explanations of the day’s objectives, challenges, and instructions.
